WebSocket -> enables real time continuous two-way communication between client and server
STOMP protocol -> gives structure to the messages i.e., organize and route messages within that connection
Message Broker -> intermediary module that receives messages from one client or source and forwards them to one or more destinations, based on defined rules.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WebSocket
Enables real-time, full-duplex (two-way) communication between client and server over a single, long-lived TCP connection.

Ideal for apps like chat, live feeds, collaborative editing, and online games.

Lightweight and faster than traditional HTTP request/response cycles.

ðŸ“Œ Think of WebSocket as the communication channel.

ðŸ”¹ STOMP (Simple Text Oriented Messaging Protocol)
A text-based messaging protocol that works over WebSocket.

Provides a structured way to format, route, and subscribe to messages.

Allows concepts like:

Topics (/topic/news) for broadcasting.

Queues (/queue/user1) for point-to-point messaging.

SUBSCRIBE, SEND, UNSUBSCRIBE, and ACK frames for message control.

ðŸ“Œ Think of STOMP as the language or grammar used over the WebSocket.

ðŸ”¹ Message Broker
An intermediary that:

Accepts messages from producers (clients or backend).

Applies rules (topic matching, filters, queues).

Routes or broadcasts them to appropriate consumers (other clients).

Can be built-in (e.g., Springâ€™s SimpleBroker) or external (RabbitMQ, ActiveMQ, Kafka, etc.).

ðŸ“Œ Think of the message broker as the post office that delivers your messages to the right people.
